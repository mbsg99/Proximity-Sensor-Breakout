# Proximity-Sensor-Breakout

Visit JLCPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/RAT)

The article is being published in collaboration with JLCPCB. It is one of the most experienced PCB manufacturers with more than a decade in the field of PCB prototype and fabrication, they are committed to meeting the needs of our customers from different industries in terms of quality, delivery, cost-effectiveness and any other demanding requests.

# Introduction
The Qwiic Proximity Sensor is a simple IR presence and ambient light sensor utilizing the VCNL4040. This sensor is excellent for detecting if something has appeared in front of the sensor; detecting objects qualitatively up to 20cm away. This means you can detect if something is there, and if it is closer or further away since the last reading, but it’s difficult to say it is 7.2cm away. If you need quantitative distance readings for exact distances, check out the SparkFun 2 meter and 4 meter Time of Flight (ToF) sensors with mm accuracy.

# Ordering the PCBs From JLCPCB
Full Process is shown using Screenshots Step-wise.

Now we have got the PCB design and it’s time to order the PCB’s. For that, you just have to go to JLCPCB, and click on “QUOTE NOW” button.

JLCPCB are also sponsor of this project. JLCPCB (ShenzhenJLC Electronics Co., Ltd.), is the largest PCB prototype enterprise in Chinaand a high-tech manufacturer specializing in quick PCB prototype and small-batch PCB production. You can order a minimum of 5 PCBs for just $2.

To get the PCB manufactured, upload the gerber file you downloaded in the last step. Upload the.zip file or you can also drag and drop the gerber files.

After uploading the zip file, you’ll see a success message at the bottom if the file is successfully uploaded.

You can review the PCB in the Gerber viewer to make sure everything is good. You can view both top and bottom of the PCB. After making sure our PCB looks good, we can now place the order at a reasonable price. You can order 5 PCBs for just $2 but if it’s your first order then you can get 5 PCBs for $2.

To place the order, click on “SAVE TO CART” button. My PCBs took 2 days to get manufactured and arrived within a week using DHL delivery option. PCBs were well packed and the quality was really good.
